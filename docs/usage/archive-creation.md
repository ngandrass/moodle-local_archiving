# Archive Creation

The archive creation form can be reached from the [course archiving overview](overview.md) by clicking on the desired
activity or directly from within the activity by clicking on {{ moodle_nav_path('More', 'Archiving') }} inside the
secondary navigation.

The form elements largely depend on the targeted activity type. In the example above, a quiz activity is being archived.
All settings feature a comprehensive help text that explains their effect in detail. It can be accessed by hovering over
the question mark symbol next to each setting.

To create the archiving job, click the _Create archive_ button at the bottom of the form. You should now see a
confirmation message and a newly created job in the table at the bottom of the page. You can monitor the progress of the
archive job by clicking on the refresh button in the top right corner of the table or by navigating to the job logs page
of the respective archive job.

If you wish to select another activity, use the _Cancel_ button to return to the archiving overview without creating a
new job.
