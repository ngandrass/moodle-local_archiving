# Moodle Archiving Subsystem

This is the official documentation for the Moodle Archiving Subsystem project. It provides a solid framework for
archiving data from various Moodle activities, such as quizzes and assignments, and transferring it to different storage
locations, such as the Moodle file store or external WORM storage systems.
