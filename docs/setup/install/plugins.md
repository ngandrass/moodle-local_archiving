# Sub-Plugins

The [archiving core plugin](core.md) is distributed with a default set of sub-plugins (e.g., activity archiving drivers,
storage drivers, ...). These will be automatically installed alongside the core plugin. Adding and removing any of the
available sub-plugins is described in this section.

You can find an overview of available sub-plugins types as well as a list of available sub-plugins on the
[components page](../../components.md):

## Installing sub-plugins

All sub-plugins must be installed inside a plugin-type specific subfolder inside the `local/archiving/driver` directory
of your Moodle installation. The table below lists the different installation locations.

| Sub-plugin type                                                             | Component        | Installation directory         |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| [Activity archiving driver](../../components.md#activity-archiving-drivers) | `archivingmod`   | `local/archiving/driver/mod`   |
| [Storage driver](../../components.md#storage-drivers)                       | `archivingstore` | `local/archiving/driver/store` |
| [External event connector](../../components.md#external-event-connectors)   | `archivingevent` | `local/archiving/driver/event` |

After placing the sub-plugins code inside the correct directory (e.g., `local/archiving/driver/mod/quiz` for
`archivingmod_quiz`), log into your Moodle site as an admin and go to _Site administration_ to complete the
installation.

!!! info "Check the sub-plugin documentation"
    Sub-plugins may require additional setup steps or dependencies to be met. Please always check the documentation of
    the sub-plugin you are installing for additional information.
