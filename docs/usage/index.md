## Course archiving overview

This plugin provides a comprehensive archiving overview page that lists all archivable activities within a Moodle
course. To access this page, navigate to a Moodle course in that you have manager rights and click on _More > Archiving_
to open the archiving overview page.


## Creating an archive job

Archive jobs can be created from the archiving overview page. To create a new archive job, click on the activity you
want to archive. This will take you to the archive creation page. There you can adjust the archive settings and finally
create a new archive job by clicking the _Create archive_ button.

You should now see a confirmation message and a newly created job in the table at the bottom of the page. You can
monitor the progress of the archive job by clicking on the refresh button in the top right corner of the table or by
navigating to the job logs page of the respective archive job.


## Downloading archived data

Once a job finished successfully, you can use the download button in the job table to list and access all artifacts that
have been created during the archive job.
